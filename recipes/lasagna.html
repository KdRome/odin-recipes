        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
            I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread. Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. 
            Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor. Try this homemade lasagna recipe today!
